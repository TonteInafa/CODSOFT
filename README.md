# CodSoft Internship Projects  

This repository contains the three tasks I completed during my internship at CodSoft. Each project focuses on solving a real-world problem using machine learning and data analysis.  

Projects  

1. Sales Prediction Model  
- Goal: Predict sales based on features like advertising budgets and pricing.  
- Approach: 
  - Cleaned and preprocessed the data.  
  - Performed EDA to understand trends.  
  - Trained models like Linear Regression and Decision Trees.  
- Outcome: Developed a model that accurately predicts sales trends.  

2. Movie Rating Prediction  
- Goal: Predict movie ratings using user reviews and other features.  
- Approach:  
  - Processed text data using TF-IDF.  
  - Extracted relevant features.  
  - Trained models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.  
- Outcome: Built a model that effectively predicts movie ratings.  

3. Titanic Survival Prediction  
-Goal: Predict passenger survival based on demographic and ticket details.  
- Approach:  
  - Conducted EDA to analyze survival factors.  
  - Engineered features like family size and title.  
  - Trained classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM).  
- Outcome: Created a model with high accuracy in predicting survival.  

Tools & Libraries  
- Python,Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn,Matplotlib,Seaborn and others 

Key Takeaways  
These projects helped me improve my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization.
